# Unreal Engine Plugin: Advanced Control Flow

The Multi-Branches is a Unreal Engine plugin which adds a custom Blueprint node Multi-Branches to realize the multiple conditional branches (like if-elseif-else statement).  
Stacking Branch nodes is a common implementation to realize the multiple conditional branches, but you can realize it with only one Multi-Branches node.
